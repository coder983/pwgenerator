# pwgenerator

This is a personal project that I started because I got tired of thinking up new and original passwords and I didn't like the gobbledigoop
passwords Mozilla, Safari, etc developed for you.

The project is being developed in Java, using the Spring Boot SpringMVC, Spring Data frameworks. The front end uses the Thyme templating system.
I'm using MySQL as the database. I have not exported the schema yet but pattern your tables to fit the event, name, and place domain objects. 
Once the tables are set up, populate them with:
                                1. names and years(I used birth year for my relatives) for names table
                                2. favorite places for the places table
                                3  events and years(I used events in history) for the events table

I have installed this on my Windows laptop and have been using it for about a month. I plan to make improvements including being able to adjust the 
special characters use. Right now they are static. I'm also going to clean up the UI with React and Bootstrap.
